SlashPin adds a TomTom-style slash command to simplify usage of the new map pin system introduced in the default UI with patch 9.0.

**/pin x y**: Set a pin at x, y  
**/pin clear**: Clear current pin

*Example: /pin 45.06 78.10*

Note that not every zone supports adding pins, and only one pin can be set at a time.
