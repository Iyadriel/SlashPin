SlashPin adds TomTom-style slash commands to simplify usage of the new map pin system introduced in the default UI with patch 9.0.

**/pin \<x\> \<y\>**: Place a pin at x, y  
**/pin \<zone\> \<x\> \<y\>**: Place a pin at x, y in zone  
**/pin clear**: Clear current pin

Examples:  
*/pin 45.06 78.10  
/pin Stormwind City 45.06 78.10*

Note that not every zone supports adding pins, and only one pin can be set at a time.

Thank you to the authors of LibTourist and TomTom for making this AddOn possible.
